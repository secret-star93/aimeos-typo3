What does it do?
----------------

The Aimeos TYPO3 extension is a high performance web shop based on the Aimeos web shop
library. It integrates natively into TYPO3, uses the TYPO3 infrastructure and is fully
configurable via TypoScript.

Aimeos can efficiently handle 100 000+ products in a standard MySQL database with response
times around 250ms using the TYPO3 infrastructure. For optimal performance you need to
install APCu and use PHP 7.1 and later.
